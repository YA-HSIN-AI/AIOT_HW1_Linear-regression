## AIOT_HW1_Linear-regression
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model using synthetic data,
following the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology.
It is implemented with Python + Streamlit for interactive visualization.

ðŸ“– CRISP-DM Steps
#1. Business Understanding

Define project objectives and requirements.

Establish success criteria (e.g., predicting stock price trends, providing visualization).

Align with course learning goals.

#2. Data Understanding

Collect, describe, and explore the synthetic dataset.

Understand data format, types, and distributions.

Detect anomalies and observe data trends.

#3. Data Preparation

Generate X values (0 ~ 10).

Compute y = ax + b + Gaussian noise.

Prepare data in suitable format for modeling.

#4. Modeling

Apply Linear Regression (sklearn).

Train model using (X, y).

Predict fitted regression line.

#5. Evaluation

Validate model performance with:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (RÂ²)

Compare true equation vs fitted regression line.

#6. Deployment

Deploy app via Streamlit.

Provide visualization and interactive controls.

Include documentation and usage instructions.
